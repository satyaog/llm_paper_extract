  "description": "The paper discusses the potential of detecting the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) through the inverse-beta-decay (IBD) detection channel on free protons. Using the latest DSNB flux predictions, the study evaluates background suppression and optimization techniques aiming to achieve significant detection sensitivity.",

    "quote": "The DSNB signal calculation depends on a variety of important ingredients [24â€“26]. The first one is the cosmological SN rate as a function of the progenitor mass and redshift, which is the link to the cosmic history of the star formation. The second ingredient is the average energy spectrum of SN neutrinos. According to the latest large-scale SN numerical simulation [25, 26], there are more astrophysical or physical effects which may alter the DSNB"
