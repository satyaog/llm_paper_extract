description: This survey explores how transformers are employed in reinforcement learning to tackle challenges like unstable
  training, credit assignment, lack of interpretability, and partial observability. It covers applications of transformers
  in different RL contexts, including representation learning, modeling transition and reward functions, and policy optimization.
  It also reviews training strategies, interpretability techniques, and real-world applications of transformers in RL.
