  "description": "This paper adopts the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to address challenges in phylogenetics, specifically focusing on parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. The authors introduce a novel model, PhyloGFN, and demonstrate its competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. The paper makes significant contributions to the field by offering effective solutions for sampling multimodal posterior distributions over tree topologies and evolutionary distances.",
