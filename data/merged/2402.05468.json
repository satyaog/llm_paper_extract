  "description": "The paper presents a new algorithm called Implicit Diffusion, which focuses on optimizing distributions defined implicitly by parameterized stochastic diffusions. This algorithm performs optimization and sampling steps jointly in a single loop, inspired by bilevel optimization and automatic implicit differentiation techniques. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through various experiments.",
