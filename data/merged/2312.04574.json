  "description": "This paper explores the emergent field of differentiable visual computing, which aims to merge the precision of visual computing methods (geometry processing, animation, and rendering) with the adaptive, data-efficient capabilities of deep learning. The study presents a systematic vision for a unified pipeline that facilitates the differentiable computation of gradients across these visual computing domains, enhancing their performance in solving complex real-world problems.",
