  quote: 'Neural Bee Colony Optimization: A Case Study in Public Transit Network Design'
description: This paper explores the combination of metaheuristics and neural network solvers for combinatorial optimization,
  specifically focusing on the transit network design problem (NDP). It proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) policy
  model that is incorporated into a modified Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic algorithm, termed Neural BCO (NBCO).
  The experimental results show that NBCO outperforms both the standalone GNN and the traditional BCO algorithm on realistic
  problem instances.
type:
  value: empirical study
  justification: The paper involves conducting experiments to compare the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm with
    other models on benchmark datasets.
  quote: Our experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid algorithm outperforms the learned policy alone by up to 20%
    and the original BCO algorithm by up to 53% on realistic problem instances.
