  "description": "The paper proposes the Ordered Memory architecture, inspired by Ordered Neurons. It introduces a new attention-based mechanism and a new Gated Recursive Cell (GRC). The Ordered Memory model is evaluated on tasks like logical inference and list operations, showing strong performance and the ability to interpret induced tree structures.",
