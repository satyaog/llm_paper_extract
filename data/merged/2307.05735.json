  "description": "This paper introduces GOKU-UI, an evolution of the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) generative model GOKU-nets. GOKU-UI has enhanced capabilities like integrating other classes of differential equations, including Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), attention mechanisms, and a multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space. These modifications are shown to significantly improve the model's performance in both reconstruction and forecast tasks for synthetic and empirical data, particularly in capturing complex brain dynamics.",

    "quote": "Our experiments indicated that non-variational GOKU-nets models outperform their variational counterparts significantly (see Supplementary Information C). Therefore, we used non-variational GOKU-nets for all the remaining results in this work. Specifically, instead of sampling from normal distributions in the latent space as shown in Figure 1, we directly take the mean values µz and µθ ."
