  "description": "This paper introduces DP-RDM, a differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model for generating high-quality image samples with rigorous privacy guarantees. The proposed algorithm generates images from text prompts without fine-tuning the model on private datasets, thereby addressing sample-level memorization issues in text-to-image diffusion models. The method is validated on datasets like MS-COCO, Shutterstock, and CIFAR-10, showing significant improvements.",
