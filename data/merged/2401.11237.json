  "description": "This paper examines the capacity of certain reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to stitch together pieces of experience to solve tasks not seen during training, and investigates whether supervised learning (SL)-based RL methods possess this stitching property. It introduces new datasets to test this and proposes temporal data augmentation to improve generalization in SL-based RL methods.",

    "value": "Empirical study",
    "justification": "The paper includes both theoretical analysis and empirical results to support its claims.",
    "quote": "Our analysis shows that this sort of generalization is different from i.i.d. generalization. This connection between stitching and generalisation reveals why we should not expect SL-based RL methods to perform stitching, even in the limit of large datasets and models. Based on this analysis, we construct new datasets to explicitly test for this property, revealing that SL-based methods lack this stitching property and hence fail to perform combinatorial generalization."
