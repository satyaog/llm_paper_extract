  quote: Neighbor-Aware Calibration of Segmentation Networks with Penalty-Based Constraints
description: The paper discusses the issue of miscalibration in deep segmentation networks, particularly in the context of
  medical image analysis. It critiques the existing Spatially Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS) method and proposes a new approach
  called Neighbor Aware CaLibration (NACL). This method offers more flexibility and control over the imposed constraints,
  thereby improving both the calibration and segmentation performance of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments on various
  medical image segmentation benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed approach.
