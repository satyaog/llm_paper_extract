    "description": "This paper presents a framework that learns a progressive compressed representation of 3D meshes for efficient transmission. The proposed method utilizes a subdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture to compress high-resolution meshes into a representation that can be progressively transmitted to a client, allowing for real-time improvements in reconstruction quality.",
