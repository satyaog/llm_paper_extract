    "description": "The paper introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment, and a neural network-based approach for creating navigation agents for the visually impaired. It addresses the inadequacies of existing reinforcement learning environments for sidewalk navigation and proposes a multi-modal observation method to improve navigation. The paper also provides a dataset and experimental results to spark further research in assistive navigation for the visually impaired.",
