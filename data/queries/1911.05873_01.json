    "description": "The paper presents a novel reduction from Reinforcement Learning (RL) to no-regret Online Learning (OL) by leveraging the saddle-point formulation of RL. This approach enables any no-regret online learning algorithm to design RL policies with provable performance guarantees. The reduction decouples RL into regret minimization and function approximation, facilitating more systematic RL algorithm design. An RL algorithm based on this reduction, using the mirror descent algorithm and a generative-model oracle, is proposed and shown to achieve improved sample complexity.",
