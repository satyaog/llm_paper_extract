    "description": "The paper investigates the application of two safety engineering frameworks, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), to identify potential social and ethical risks in the development and use of text-to-image (T2I) models. The authors conducted a case study focusing on various stages of the ML product development pipeline, including data processing, model integration, and end-use by artists. The research reveals that examining interactions and processes through these frameworks can uncover a range of failures and hazards beyond performance metrics of a single model.",
