    "description": "The paper introduces a novel framework for textual few-shot classification using API-based models. It presents a scenario that captures real-world constraints, proposes a transductive inference method for leveraging unlabeled data through a Fisher-Rao loss parameter-free transductive regularizer, and compiles a benchmark of eight datasets for better experimental evaluations.",

Second, we propose a transductive inference, a learning paradigm that has been overlooked by the NLP community."
