    "description": "This paper introduces a framework for generating interpretable and verifiable logical rules through differentiable learning without relying on pre-specified logical structures. The framework is built upon SATNet, a differentiable MaxSAT solver, and proposes a novel method called 'maximum equality' to transform learned weights into human-readable propositional logical rules. The approach is validated through experiments on stream transformations and Sudoku puzzles, showing high reliability and accuracy.",
