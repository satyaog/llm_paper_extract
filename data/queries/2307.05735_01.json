    "description": "The paper introduces GOKU-UI, an evolution of the SciML generative model GOKU-nets, incorporating attention mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space. These enhancements significantly improve the model's performance in both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated on simulated and empirical human brain data. The model's data efficiency and ability to capture complex brain dynamics using resting state fMRI data are highlighted.",
