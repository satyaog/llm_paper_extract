    "description": "This paper introduces the Generative Multisensory Network (GMN) for learning latent representations of 3D scenes from multiple sensory modalities. It proposes the Amortized Product-of-Experts (APoE) to improve computational efficiency and robustness to unseen modality combinations. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GMN in inferring robust 3D scene representations and performing accurate cross-modal generation using a newly developed environment, the Multisensory Embodied 3D-Scene Environment (MESE).",
