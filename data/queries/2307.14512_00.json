    "description": "This paper investigates the characteristics and maintenance challenges of bugs in ML-based systems using empirical data from GitHub repositories employing TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. It aims to differentiate between ML and non-ML bugs and to understand their distribution, complexity, root causes, symptoms, and resource demands.",
