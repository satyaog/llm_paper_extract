    "description": "The paper investigates the stitching property in reinforcement learning (RL), which allows RL algorithms to generalize and solve tasks not seen during training. It compares RL methods based on dynamic programming with supervised learning (SL) based methods. The paper finds that SL-based methods often lack this stitching property but proposes a temporal data augmentation technique to improve their performance.",
