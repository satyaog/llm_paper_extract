    "description": "The paper presents a framework based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure energy sufficiency of robots navigating unknown and unstructured environments. The framework can be integrated with various path planners, including those used for exploration missions. It guarantees that robots will not run out of energy during their missions, validated through both simulation and real-world experiments.",
