    "description": "This paper proposes an event-based algorithm to address the load balancing challenge in multi-band 5G networks. The authors model the load balancing problem as a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem, aiming to evenly distribute traffic across available bands while minimizing the number of inter-frequency handovers. The proposed algorithm enhances network performance in terms of throughput and interruption time compared to traditional load balancing methods.",
