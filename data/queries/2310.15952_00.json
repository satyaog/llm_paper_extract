    "description": "This paper introduces a three-stage method to enhance model robustness in medical image classification without relying on predetermined data augmentation strategies. The approach integrates transformers with conditional diffusion models and a novel Nested-Ensemble technique. Extensive experiments on medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness, confidence calibration, and prediction uncertainty quantification.",
