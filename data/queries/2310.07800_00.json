    "description": "This paper introduces FewXAT, a novel explainable attention mechanism designed to enhance few-shot learning performance by identifying and focusing on essential image regions. The method uses deep reinforcement learning to find hard attention regions, which results in improved model interpretability and efficiency. Experimental results show performance improvements across various benchmark datasets and potential applicability to broader computer vision tasks.",
