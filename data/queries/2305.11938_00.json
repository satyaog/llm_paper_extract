    "description": "The paper presents X TREME -U P, a benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on under-represented languages (ULs) using scarce data. It focuses on user-centric tasks prevalent among high-resource languages. The benchmark comprises 88 languages and nine key technologies, including OCR, ASR, MT, autocomplete, semantic parsing, and transliteration. The paper provides baseline results and recommends the development of more inclusive multilingual NLP technologies.",
