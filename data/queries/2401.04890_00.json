    "description": "This work introduces a principle called mechanism sparsity regularization to achieve partial disentanglement of latent factors by learning the sparse causal graphical model that explains them. The authors develop a nonparametric identifiability theory and propose an estimation procedure involving variational autoencoders and a sparsity constraint. The theory and method are tested using various synthetic datasets.",
