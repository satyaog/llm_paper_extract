    "description": "This paper details the creation and analysis of the BigScience ROOTS corpus, a comprehensive multilingual dataset consisting of 1.6TB of text spanning 59 languages. It documents the data curation efforts, including the roles of various working groups, the preprocessing and filtering steps, as well as the ethical considerations behind the project. The dataset was used to train the 176-billion-parameter BLOOM language model.",
