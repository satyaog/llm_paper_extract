    "description": "This paper introduces V-STaR, an approach designed to train verifiers by utilizing both correct and incorrect solutions generated during the self-improvement process of Large Language Models (LLMs). V-STaR contrasts itself with existing methods by leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to improve verifier and generator performance iteratively. The empirical results exhibit significant enhancements in test accuracy over prior methods in code generation and math reasoning benchmarks.",
