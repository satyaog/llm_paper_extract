    "description": "The paper investigates changes in handover behavior when transferring hazardous objects with the help of a high-resolution touch sensor. Through experiments where participants handover a safe and hazardous object while using a modified sensor, the study identifies key tactile factors influencing the negotiation phase and overall handover duration. The goal is to inform safer human-robot interactions by understanding human-human handover dynamics.",
