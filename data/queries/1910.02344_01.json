    "description": "The paper proposes the Generative Multisensory Network (GMN) for learning latent representations of 3D scenes which are partially observable through multiple sensory modalities. It also introduces the Amortized Product-of-Experts (APoE), a novel method to improve computational efficiency and robustness to unseen combinations of modalities at test time. The paper highlights the ability of the model to infer robust and modality-invariant 3D-scene representations from various combinations of sensory modalities and perform accurate cross-modal generation.",
