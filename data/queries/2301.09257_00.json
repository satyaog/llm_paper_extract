    "description": "The paper proposes a novel real-time LiDAR intensity image-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method. This method aims to address the geometry degeneracy problem in unstructured environments by extracting feature points from LiDAR-generated point clouds that match features identified in LiDAR intensity images. The method includes a front-end odometry and a back-end for joint optimization of distances between feature points and points to plane. Experimental results indicate high accuracy and robustness in various environments.",
