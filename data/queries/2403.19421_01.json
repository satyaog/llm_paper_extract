    "description": "The paper evaluates various parallelization techniques to improve the training time of ridge regression for brain encoding using the CNeuroMod Friends dataset. It compares multi-threading, using libraries like Intel MKL and OpenBLAS, and distributed computing with Dask, proposing a new Batch-MultiOutput approach that showed significant speed-ups across multiple compute nodes and threads.",
