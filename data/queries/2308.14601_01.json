    "description": "This paper explores the intrinsic relationship between music discovery and popularity bias, and proposes a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach to address popularity bias in graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems. The approach leverages musical similarity for more accurate and fair music recommendations.",
