    "description": "This paper explores the application of transformers in reinforcement learning, discussing how they address traditional challenges in RL, including unstable training and partial observability. The paper provides a comprehensive survey of how transformers are used in different RL tasks, such as representation learning, transition and reward function modeling, and policy optimization. It also examines recent research efforts to improve transformers' interpretability and efficiency in RL.",
