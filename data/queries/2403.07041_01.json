    "description": "This paper introduces the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel neural-guided meta-heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. GFACS integrates generative flow networks (GFlowNets) with the ant colony optimization (ACO) methodology. The proposed approach, accompanied by multiple training enhancements, demonstrates superior performance over traditional ACO and DeepACO algorithms in solving optimization tasks such as vehicle routing and scheduling problems.",
