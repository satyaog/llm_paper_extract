    "description": "This paper introduces Swarm-SLAM, a decentralized framework for Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) that is optimized for use in multi-robot systems, particularly in challenging environments without an external positioning system. The framework supports various sensor modalities including lidar, stereo, and RGB-D cameras, and aims to enhance resource efficiency, scalability, and robustness through a novel inter-robot loop closure prioritization technique and decentralized optimization approach. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",
